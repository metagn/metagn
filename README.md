Hello, I am currently a student at Middle East Technical University. I have experience with many languages, but currently I mostly use Nim. My most significant projects include:

* [marggers](https://github.com/metagn/marggers), a markdown dialect with the goal of customization for websites
* [kismet](https://github.com/metagn/kismet), my first major attempt at a programming language
* [fup1](https://github.com/metagn/fup1), tetris implementation as an experiment with macros for more games in the future
* [bazy](https://github.com/metagn/bazy), in-development experimental scripting language with a focus on types, macros and dynamic dispatch
* [Contributions to Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/commits?author=metagn)
* Several small Nim libraries:
  - [applicates](https://github.com/metagn/applicates), anonymous symbols or declarations as values for efficient FP-like constructs
  - [assigns](https://github.com/metagn/assigns), unpacking/matching macro library
  - [grab](https://github.com/metagn/grab), a macro for installing and importing a package through nimble for scripts and such
  - [shorteststring](https://github.com/metagn/shorteststring), implementation of a very small string stored in a word-size integer
  - [sliceutils](https://github.com/metagn/sliceutils), some abstractions on slices + tuple slicing
  - [spread](https://github.com/metagn/spread), a macro for spreading a block of arguments into a routine call or collection literal
  - [variantsugar](https://github.com/metagn/variantsugar), macros mainly meant for object variants that interface directly with existing types
