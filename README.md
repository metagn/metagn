Hello, I am metagn, mainly a hobbyist/open source developer. I have experience with a variety of languages, the most being with Java/JVM languages, but I've mostly used Nim for the last couple of years. 

If you want to support my work please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/metagn/) or [donating](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/metagn). Being a student in Turkey, any amount means a lot.

Some of my projects are:

* [Contributions to Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/commits?author=metagn)
* Several Nim libraries, see below
* [marggers](https://github.com/metagn/marggers) - portable and configurable parser for a markdown dialect

Nim libraries:

|  | most can be found on [nimble](https://nimble.directory) | 
| --: | :-- |
| [grab](https://github.com/metagn/grab) | inline package installs, like groovy @Grab |
| [applicates](https://github.com/metagn/applicates) | first-class templates/AST/symbols |
| [assigns](https://github.com/metagn/assigns) | overloadable pattern matching |
| [spread](https://github.com/metagn/spread) | block syntax for calls/literals/constructors |
| [variantsugar](https://github.com/metagn/variantsugar) | stackable utility macros for object variants |
| [sliceutils](https://github.com/metagn/sliceutils) | slice/range abstractions |
| [shorteststring](https://github.com/metagn/shorteststring) | word-size string |
| [etf](https://github.com/metagn/etf) | ETF library |
| [funnycapitalism](https://github.com/metagn/funnycapitalism) | barebones discord library |

Ongoing projects:

* [bazy](https://github.com/metagn/bazy) - in-development scripting language with a focus on types, macros and dynamic dispatch

Other, less active projects include:

* [kismet](https://github.com/metagn/kismet) - first programming language project
* [fup1](https://github.com/metagn/fup1) - tetris implementation using a custom macro library
