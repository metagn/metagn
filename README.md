Hello, I am a mostly open source developer currently studying mathematics at Middle East Technical University. I have experience with a variety of languages, the most being with Java/JVM languages and Python, but recently I've used Nim a lot. My most significant projects include:

* [Contributions to Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/commits?author=metagn)
* Several Nim libraries:
  - [grab](https://github.com/metagn/grab) - direct package install and import statement in Nim code
  - [variantsugar](https://github.com/metagn/variantsugar) - in-place, chainable object variant utility macros with pragma syntax support
  - [assigns](https://github.com/metagn/assigns) - overloadable pattern matching/unpacking macros for Nim
  - [applicates](https://github.com/metagn/applicates) - compile time anonymous templates and symbols as values
  - [sliceutils](https://github.com/metagn/sliceutils) - utilities and abstractions for the Slice type
  - [shorteststring](https://github.com/metagn/shorteststring) - word-size stack string implementation
  - [spread](https://github.com/metagn/spread) - macro for block arguments for function calls/collection literals
* [marggers](https://github.com/metagn/marggers) - portable and configurable parser for a markdown dialect
* [bazy](https://github.com/metagn/bazy) - in-development scripting language with a focus on types, macros and dynamic dispatch
  
If you want to support my work please consider sponsoring or donating. Being a student in Turkey, any amount means a lot.

Other projects include:

* [kismet](https://github.com/metagn/kismet) - first programming language project
* [fup1](https://github.com/metagn/fup1) - tetris implementation using a custom macro library
