Hello, I am currently a student at Middle East Technical University. I have experience with many languages, chiefly Java/JVM languages and Python, but currently I mostly use Nim. My most significant projects include:

* [Contributions to Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/commits?author=metagn)
* [marggers](https://github.com/metagn/marggers) - portable and configurable parser for a markdown dialect
* [bazy](https://github.com/metagn/bazy) - in-development scripting language with a focus on types, macros and dynamic dispatch
* Several Nim libraries:
  - [grab](https://github.com/metagn/grab) - installing and directly importing nimble packages at compile time
  - [variantsugar](https://github.com/metagn/variantsugar) - in-place, stackable object variant utility macros with pragma syntax support
  - [assigns](https://github.com/metagn/assigns) - pattern matching/unpacking macros for Nim
  - [applicates](https://github.com/metagn/applicates) - Nim compile time mechanism allowing anonymous templates and passing around symbols as values
  - [sliceutils](https://github.com/metagn/sliceutils) - utilities and abstractions for the Slice type
  - [shorteststring](https://github.com/metagn/shorteststring) - implementation of a very small string stored in a word-size integer
  - [spread](https://github.com/metagn/spread) - macro for applying a block of arguments in a routine call or collection literal

Other projects include:

* [kismet](https://github.com/metagn/kismet) - first experience in programming language development
* [fup1](https://github.com/metagn/fup1) - tetris implementation centered around a custom macro system

* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/metagn) (only use it when bored but somehow racked up a lot of points)
